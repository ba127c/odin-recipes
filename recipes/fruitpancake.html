    <p>A fruity and fluffy Japanese-style pancake.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup pancake mix</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>4 egg whites</li>

        <li>syrup, to serve</li>
        <li>1 cup assorted fruits, to serve</li>

        <li>Mix together the egg yolks, sugar, milk, and pancake mix in a very large bowl until it is smooth with no large lumps.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form when lifted.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the egg whites into the pancake batter, until just incorporated, making sure not to deflate the batter.</li>
        <li>Grease two 3.5-inch (9 cm) metal ring moulds and set them in the middle of a pan over the lowest heat possible.</li>
        <li>Fill the moulds about Â¾ of the way full with the batter, then cover the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, until the center of the pancakes are slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Release the pancakes from the bottom of the pan with a spatula, then carefully flip them over, making sure not to spill any batter inside.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for another 5 minutes, then serve with butter, syrup, and fruits!</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
